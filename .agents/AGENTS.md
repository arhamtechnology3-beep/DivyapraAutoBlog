## 🚨 MANDATORY WORKSPACE & STORE TARGET VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL SAFEGUARD TO PREVENT CROSS-STORE ACCIDENTAL PUBLISHING:**
- **Active Workspace Directory:** Must ALWAYS be verified as `/Users/apple/Documents/Shopify Theme VS code/DivyaPrabha Food`
- **Target Live Store:** Must ALWAYS be verified as `divyaprabhafoods.com` (Divyaprabha Foods Theme)
- **STRICT PROHIBITION:** NEVER push, sync, publish, or deploy any code updates, theme changes, features, or CLI commands to `The Pickle Affair` (`pickleaffair.com` / `thepickleaffair.com`) when operating within this workspace.
- **Pre-Execution Protocol:** Before executing any Shopify CLI commands (`shopify theme push`, `shopify theme dev`, `theme-check`, etc.), Git operations, or code modifications, verify that the working folder is strictly `DivyaPrabha Food` and target environment is `divyaprabhafoods.com`.

## 🔑 Shopify Admin API token (Partner apps — remember for every project)

Partner / Dev Dashboard apps (**AutoBlog**, **Cursor SEO**, etc.) do **not** show a permanent `shpat_` in the Shopify UI. Always exchange **Client ID + Client secret** via client-credentials:

**Postman / curl**
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `https://divyaprabhafoods.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/access_token`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `Accept: application/json`
- Body (x-www-form-urlencoded):
  - `grant_type` = `client_credentials`
  - `client_id` = from `dev.shopify.com` → Apps → app → **Settings → Credentials**
  - `client_secret` = `shpss_…` from the same page
- Response `access_token` is `shpat_…` (typically ~24h TTL). Re-run when expired.
- Helper: `scratch/shopify_get_access_token.py`

Never paste Client secrets or `shpat_` into chat. Prefer Cursor/GitHub secrets.

## 🎯 9 Mandatory Execution Rules

1. **Verify Workspace Folder & Target Theme First:** Check current path `/Users/apple/Documents/Shopify Theme VS code/DivyaPrabha Food` and ensure all updates post ONLY to `divyaprabhafoods.com` live theme. Never leak changes to `The Pickle Affair`.
2. **Word Count & Depth:** Target **1,200–1,500 words minimum** per post, structured with clean H2/H3 subheadings, ingredient breakdowns, health angles, storage tips, and visual product cards.
3. **Title Tag Length:** Place primary keyword first. Keep title tags strictly **under 60 characters** to prevent truncation in Google search results.
4. **FAQ Section:** Include a 3–5 question FAQ section at the end of every post addressing common buyer and informational queries.
5. **Structured Data (JSON-LD Schema):** Embed valid JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">` schema for `Article` / `BlogPosting` and `FAQPage` inside the HTML body.
6. **Specific Product Internal Links:** Link directly to specific live product handles (`/products/mango-pickle-traditional-keri-achar-gujarati`, `/products/gor-keri-pickle-jaggery-mango-achar-gujarati`, `/products/chhundo-pickle-sweet-shredded-mango-achar-gujarati`, `/products/gunda-keri-pickle-lasode-ka-achar-gujarati`, `/products/katka-keri-pickle-homemade-gujarati-mango-achar`, `/products/sweet-mango-pickle-meethi-keri-achar-homemade`, `/products/chana-keri-methi-pickle-gujarati-methia-achar`). NEVER link to empty 0-item collections!
7. **Consolidated Tag Taxonomy:** Assign only from the 5 core categories (`Heritage Recipes`, `Health & Spices`, `Buying Guides`, `Pickle Pairings`, `Artisanal Craft`). Ensure CMS tags and front-end category filters match 100%.
8. **Authentic Store Product CDN Images & 1-to-1 Product CTA Boxes:** For every blog post (present and future), DO NOT use AI-generated images or generic placeholders. Use authentic Divyaprabha Shopify CDN store product jar images (`SpecialMangoBig.webp`, `Gor_Keri_500g.webp`, `GundaKeriBig.webp`, `ChhundoBigFront.webp`, `Chana_Keri_Methi_Big.webp`, `KatkaKeriBigfront_jpg.webp`, `SweetmangoBigFront.webp`) matching the exact products sold on `divyaprabhafoods.com`. Every blog post MUST target ONE specific product URL (`/products/<handle>`) with an embedded high-converting Product CTA box featuring the real product image, price, title, and direct buy button. Ensure EVERY image has a descriptive SEO `alt` tag including the exact primary SEO Focus Keyword.
9. **100% Structural & Narrative Content Uniqueness (Zero Boilerplate & Zero Plagiarism):** Every blog post (present and future) MUST be 100% unique in concept, angle, action calls, introductory hooks, and H2/H3 outline structure. DO NOT use generic repetitive intro text ("When culinary enthusiasts and home cooks search for...") or formulaic subheadings ("1. What Makes Authentic [Product] Unique? 2. Baa's 45-Year Saurashtra Heritage..."). Tailor every article with fresh storytelling, distinct culinary angles, unique FAQ questions, and custom action calls.
10. **Mandatory Grade A+ SEO Score (95–100/100 Points Target):** Every new blog post generated or published MUST be pre-audited and scored at Grade A+ (95–100 Pts). It MUST satisfy: (1) Title < 60 chars with primary keyword first (15 Pts), (2) Word count >= 1,200 words minimum (15 Pts), (3) Dual JSON-LD Article + FAQPage schemas (15 Pts), (4) 3–5 question FAQ section (10 Pts), (5) Product CTA card with real store CDN image & alt text (15 Pts), (6) 100% valid product link handles with zero 404s (10 Pts), (7) Tag assigned from the 5 core categories (10 Pts), and (8) 100% unique non-boilerplate narrative structure (10 Pts).
